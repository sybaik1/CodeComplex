# CodeComplex: Dataset for Worst-Case Time Complexity Prediction

CodeComplex is a comprehensive dataset designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in the complex task of worst-case time complexity prediction for code. The dataset features **4,900 Java codes** and **4,900 Python codes**, annotated with detailed complexity labels across seven distinct classes. It provides a robust benchmark for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in software development.

## üìú Features

- **Bilingual Dataset**: Includes both Java and Python codes from competitive programming platforms.
- **Seven Complexity Classes**: Annotated across constant (O(1)), linear (O(n)), quadratic (O(n)), cubic (O(n¬≥)), logarithmic (O(log n)), linear-logarithmic (O(n log n)), and exponential.
- **Balanced Class Distribution**: Designed to mitigate biases and enhance model generalization.
- **Comprehensive Annotations**: Labeled by expert annotators considering input characteristics, library impacts, and control structures.
- **Novel Evaluation Metric**: Introduces the Hierarchy Complexity Score (HC-Score) for nuanced performance assessment.
